        <p>
          All my life I've always loved computers, During my time in high school I took many computer classes. I learned various skills, such as typing, web design, interior design.
        </p>
        <p>
          After awhile, it became more than a hobby. I started studying how every component in the computer works and what they are. For example, I learned how the computer functions.
          CPU is the core unit of the computer and has different cores that help the computer process.
        </p>

        <p>
          During my time with computers I have built a tower that can push 200+ frames in 1440p I achieve this by not letting the components bottleneck. With this change
         the computer parts will be able to function properly.

        <p>
          I love basketball because it combines physical activity with strategy and teamwork. The thrill of dribbling down the court, making precise passes, and sinking a shot provides an incredible rush.
        </p>
        <p>
          the game fosters collaboration and communication with teammates, which makes every win feel even more rewarding. Playing regularly keeps me fit while also enhancing my coordination and agility.
        </p>

          Beyond the physical benefits, basketball offers a strong sense of community and camaraderie. Whether I’m playing pickup games at the local court or participating in organized leagues, the friendships formed through the sport create lasting connections. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The excitement of competing, celebrating victories, and even learning from losses adds to my passion for the game. Overall, basketball is a dynamic and enjoyable outlet that enriches my life both on and off the court.
